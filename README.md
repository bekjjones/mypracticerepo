my practice repository to get familiar with GitHub

Hi everyone,

I have invited you all to contribute to a public GitHub repository for practise 

It is just some dummy files including text files and a HTML example from W3schools.

Please take a look around, add files, make changes and create branches to get familiar with how GitHub works.

FYI - When we are finished practising then the repository can be deleted.
